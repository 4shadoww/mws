Mediawiki scripting
===================

This repository consists a source code for a Wikipedia bot.
The bot fixes simple and common problems in articles.
It can be used automatically or semi-automatically.
It has a simple user interface for semi-automatic use where user can review the changes.
This is ideal for making quick fixes to new articles or doing big batch of simple fixes for example with regular expression.

The source code doesn't currently support multiple locales, but it could be implemented rather easily.
